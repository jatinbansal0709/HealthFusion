Languages Used: - 
I.	HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating and designing websites. It is a markup language that structures the content on the web, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, forms, and multimedia.
Use of basic HTML elements, such as: 
1.	<!DOCTYPE html>: The document type declaration. It tells the browser that the page is an HTML5 document. 
2.	<html>: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
3.	<head>: Contains meta information and links to external resources, like stylesheets and scripts. 
4.	<meta>: Provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding and viewport settings. 
5.	<title>: Defines the title of the webpage, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. <body>: Contains the main content of the web page, visible to users. 
6.	<header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>: Semantic elements that help structure the content on the page. 
7.	<h1> to <h6>: Headings, ranging from the most important (<h1>) to the least important (<h6>). 
8.	<p>: Paragraph element. <a>: Anchor element, used for creating hyperlinks.

II.	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. CSS allows you to separate the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and control the appearance of your website. You can use CSS to style various elements on a web page, such as colors, fonts, layout, and responsive design for different devices and screen sizes.

Use of basic CSS elements, such as: 
1.	color: Sets the color of the text for an element.
Example: color: #333;
2.	background-color: Sets the background color of an element.
Example: background-color: #f4f4f4;
3.	font-family: Sets the font family for the text of an element.
Example: font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
4.	font-size: Sets the font size of the text for an element.
Example: font-size: 16px;
5.	font-weight: Sets the font weight (boldness) of the text for an element.
Example: font-weight: bold;
6.	font-style: Sets the font style (italic, normal, or oblique) for an element.
Example: font-style: italic;
7.	text-decoration: Sets the text decoration (underline, overline, line-through, or none) for an element.
Example: text-decoration: underline;
8.	text-align: Sets the horizontal alignment of the text within an element.
Example: text-align: center;
9.	line-height: Sets the line height (the space between lines of text) for an element.
Example: line-height: 1.6;
10.	margin: Sets the margin (the space outside the element's border) for an element.
Example: margin: 10px;

III.	Bootstrap is not a language but a popular front-end framework for web development. It was created by Twitter and is open-source. Bootstrap makes it easier and faster to design responsive, mobile-first websites. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). Bootstrap provides pre-built components, a responsive grid system, and utility classes that help you create a consistent and modern-looking web design with minimal effort. To get started with Bootstrap, you need to include the required Bootstrap files (CSS and JavaScript) in your HTML file. You can either download the files from the official Bootstrap website (https://getbootstrap.com/) and host them locally, or you can link to the files hosted on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) directly.

Use of basic Bootstrap elements, such as: 
1.	Containers: Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using the grid system. They provide a responsive, fixed-width container or a fluid container that spans the entire width of the viewport.

2.	Grid system: Bootstrap uses a 12-column responsive grid system to create different layouts. The grid system includes rows and columns, with classes like row, col, col-md-6, etc.
3.	Typography: Bootstrap provides default styles for headings, paragraphs, lists, and other text elements.
4.	Navigation: Bootstrap provides pre-built components for creating navigation bars, dropdown menus, and more.
5.	Utilities: Bootstrap includes various utility classes for spacing (margin and padding), flexbox, borders, and more.

IV.	JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is widely used for web development. It allows you to create interactive and dynamic websites by adding functionality and behavior to static HTML and CSS content. JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs in the user's browser, but it can also be used on the server side with technologies like Node.js.

Use of basic JavaScript elements, such as: 
1.	Variables: Variables are used to store data. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords.
2.	Data Types: JavaScript has several basic data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays.
3.	Functions: Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called by name to perform specific tasks. Functions can also accept parameters and return values.
4.	Control Structures: JavaScript includes control structures such as if, else, switch, for, and while for conditional statements and loops.
5.	Objects: JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs, also known as properties. Objects can be used to store and manage complex data structures.
6.	Arrays: Arrays are ordered collections of data that can store multiple values of any data type.
